                    <div class="content">
                        <p>this past winter, a professor i was working under offered to set me up on a free trip to
                            china through a university in hebei province. china was a place i dreamt about, but
                            experienced only through stories and diasporic facsimile. i always imagined my first trip
                            there to be with my family, visiting our ancestoral villages in Guangzhou. it wasn't until i
                            was at the airport that i realized the last time i had been in a plane was when i was
                            fifteen, flying to my <span id="hover01">great-grandmother's</span> funeral in LA. <br>
                            growing up, she lived with us for half the year. our communication was limited (i was a a
                            child; she spoke few words of english and i spoke few in cantonese). she immigrated during
                            ww2. when she died i felt something sever, the final living thread connecting me to this
                            other world snapped. a million questions left unanswered.</p>

                    <p>after spending the night in beijing, i awoke in a hotel and met the rest of my travel group. a
                        collection of professors from the university, two other college students, and a handful of
                        highschoolers with their chinese teacher. we boarded the bus and made the 4 hour journey to
                        shijiazhuang, the capital of hebei province, where the university is located. <br> the scale and
                        depth of history in china is astounding. shijiazhuang is a city of 11 million people (3 million
                        more than new york), but you would be hard pressed to find a non-chinese person that has heard
                        of it. the traces of rapid industrialization and a newfound consumerist culture linger; ancient
                        military structures and <span id="hover02">buddhist temples</span> sit minutes away from
                        massive, glittering malls and

                        <p>wuqiao, a rural county with a population of 200,000 people, is the home of chinese
                            acrobatics. we arrived there at night, stopping to eat dinner at a small korean restaurant.
                            during our meal, a boy arrived, accompanied by a young man dressed in a black uniform. the
                            boy gave each of us an orange. we were told he was the son of the director of the acrobatics
                            school in wuqiao, which we would be visiting the next morning. <br> <span id="hover03">the
                                school</span> was bustling with activity as children as young as five years old
                            practiced circus arts around us. instead of studying for their college entrance exams
                            (gaokao) these children studied to become acrobats and performers. the thought of children
                            foregoing traditional education to join the circus was surreal, seeming very at-odds with
                            the cut-throat careerism china is associated with.</p>

                        pick up cough drops or masks, imagining how a local resident might run these errands regularly.
                        going alone forced me to practice the chinese i was otherwise embarrassed to attempt. </p>
